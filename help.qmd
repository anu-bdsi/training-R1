## Writing reproducible examples

If your issue is in coding, it often helps to present your problem with a minimally reproducible example (show your full code so that we can run it ourselves, details about your operating system, what was the error message?, etc). Provide us the details so that we can help you! Read more [here](https://learnr.numbat.space/chapter3).

## During the workshop

- Don't be shy and ask fellow participants in the workshop. 
- Flag and ask the teaching team.

## Outside of the workshop

- Ask people around you. A second opinion is often helpful in uncovering a step towards the solution to your problem. 
- Ask the local experts such as at the [BDSI Drop-In Sessions](https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/news-events/event-series/bdsi-bioinformatics-and-statistics-drop-sessions).
- Use online resources such as:
  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
  - [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com/)
  - Ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) or [Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).
- You can continue to use the [ANU Learning Data Slack Community](https://anu-bdsi.github.io/training-R1/#slack) to connect with each other.
