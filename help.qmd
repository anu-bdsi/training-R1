You aren't alone in your R journey. Make use of the experiences of those around you.

If your issue is in coding, it often helps to present your problem with a minimally reproducible example. Read more [here](https://learnr.numbat.space/chapter3).

## During the workshop

- Don't be shy and ask fellow participants in the workshop. 
- Flag and ask the teaching team.

## Outside of the workshop

- Ask people around you. A second opinion is often helpfu in uncovering a step towards the solution to your problem. 
- Ask the local experts such as at the [BDSI Drop-In Sessions](https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/news-events/event-series/bdsi-bioinformatics-and-statistics-drop-sessions).
- Use online resources such as:
  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
  - [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com/)
  - Ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) or [Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).
