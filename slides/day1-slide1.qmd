## Learning objectives

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## {{< fa crosshairs >}} Overall goal

Develop skills to work with your research data using R 

:::

Today:

- Setting up your data project (R project, folder structure)
- Reading data into R (csv and xlsx)
- The basics of R programming (atomic vectors, lists, data.frame, functions)
- Computing simple numerical summaries of your data in R
- Troubleshooting and producing minimal reproducible examples with `reprex`


  
  
## What is R?

::: incremental

- **R** is a programming language predominately for data analysis
- **RStudio Desktop** is an integrated development environment (**IDE**) that helps you to use R
- **R packages** are community developed extensions to R [(much like apps on your mobile)]{.grey}
- The Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**) is a volunteer maintained repository that hosts submitted R packages that are approved [(much like an app store)]{.grey}
  - There are close to 20,000 packages available on CRAN
  - The qualities of R packages vary 
- There are other repositories that host R packages, e.g. **Bioconductor** for bioinformatics [(we won't cover this)]{.grey}

## How to use R?

- RStudio Desktop (or RStudio IDE) is the most common way to use R

- You can type operations directly into the Console pane

## Why learn R?

::: incremental

- R is one of the top programming languages for statistics or data science
- R was developed by statisticians for statisticians 
- R has an active and friendly community 
- R is a free and open source software (FOSS) 
  - free = money is not a barrier to use it
  - open source software = transparency
