## 🏋️‍♀️ Exercises

### Exercise 1

Go through the exercises in [Learn R Chapter 2: R programming basics](https://learnr.numbat.space/chapter2){target="_blank"} (you can skip the Matrices section).


### Exercise 2

We will look at the `penguins` dataset that is contained in the `palmerpenguins` package. For more details about the data, see [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

```r
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
```

Using this data, answer the following questions.

1. Have a quick skim of the data. 
1. How many species were studied? 
1. How many islands are there in the data?
1. Did they find all species on every island?
1. For each biometric measure, are there difference between the species?
1. Explore the associations between the biometric measurements bill length, bill depth, flipper length and body mass. 
1. Are there differences in these associations between species?
